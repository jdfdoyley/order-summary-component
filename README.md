## Overview

In this challenge I am to build out an order summary component (see [screenshots](#screenshots) below) and get it look as close to the design as possible.

I am able to use any tools I would like to help complete this challenge. The reason for doing this challenge was so that I can practice my frontend dev skills. I have been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a while now but I have not created anything without guidance. That's what led me to Frontend Mentor.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Workflow

- **Step 1:** Initialize project directory using Git
- **Step 2:** Configure local repository to push to remote repository
- **Step 3:** Examin project design and come up with a plan on how to tackle the project
- **Step 4:** Start by creating the layout using only HTML
- **Step 5:** Start adding styles to the project using the mobile-first workflow. Style will be added in the following order using the top-down approach:
  - General content style
  - Sectional styles
- **Step 6:** Test the completeness of the project agains the design
