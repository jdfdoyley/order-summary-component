## Overview

In this challenge I am to build out an order summary component (see [screenshots](#screenshots) below) and get it look as close to the design as possible.

I am able to use any tools I would like to help complete this challenge. The reason for doing this challenge was so that I can practice my frontend dev skills. I have been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a while now but I have not created anything without guidance. That's what led me to Frontend Mentor.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Workflow

- **Step 1:** Initialize project directory using Git
- **Step 2:** Configure local repository to push to remote repository
- **Step 3:** Examine project design and come up with a plan on how to tackle the project
- **Step 4:** Start by creating the layout using only HTML
- **Step 5:** Start adding styles to the project. Style will be added in the following order using the top-down approach:
  - General content style
  - Sectional styles
- **Step 6:** Test the completeness of the project agains the design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- 8pt-Grid System
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) help with design

### What I learned

While building this project I got the opportunity to learn about the following:

#### The 8pt Grid System

The 8-pt grid system is basically using multiples of 8 to define dimensions, padding, and margin of both block and inline elements.

#### The Box Model

The box model is a way to describe an element's dimensions and spacing. This model consist of four (4) parts: the border, the margins, the padding, and  the content.
**Content**: The content of the box, where text and images appear.
**Border**: The thickness of the line/stroke that surrounds the padding and the content
**Margins**: The extra space surrounding the element
**Padding**: The space around the content; between the content and the content's borders

#### CSS Grid

I learned how to vertically and horizontally center content using `place-items`. The code is as follows:

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to keep utilizing HTML 5 semantics, Flexbox and Grids. At the moment, I don't feel comfortable using them. I will keep using them until I've gain mastery over deciding when and where to use them. I will accomplish this by doing more and more Frontend Mentor projects.

### Useful resources

- [The 8-Point Grid](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the 8-pt grid system. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
